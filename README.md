# Walking_Tours_App

1. This app is our own personal walking tour guide for an extensive number of Chicago's famous architectural "must-see" 
   buildings such as Aqua Tower, Willis Tower, Chicago Theatre, or Rookery Building. Use this self-guided walking tour to explore the most famous constructions of the Loop District, Chicago.

2. The Walking Tours app notifies the user of nearby architectural wonders when they are near the building location. 
   Tapping on a notification displays information such as a photo of the building, the building name, address, and a description of its architectural significance.

3. This app uses a Google Maps Activity to display a map showing the tour’s path, the user’s nearby surroundings, 
   the Geofence ranges, and to track and display their movement as they proceed on their tour.
